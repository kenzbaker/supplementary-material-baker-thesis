# supplementary-material-baker-thesis
A repository for the supplementary material accompanying my thesis

Contents  include:

- '1-buildInputs - 3.2.23' : script containing the steps taken to load, visualise, clip, reproject and save data as a new file

- '2-creatInputBadlands - 3.2.23' : script containg process of creating CSV files from the data created in '1-buildInputs - 3.2.23'.

- '3 - runBadlands' : the script used in Badlands to run the model simulation. Import XML file into this file to run a model.

- 'Globaldata': Folder containing all input data acquired for the process of clipping and reprojecting. This includes palaeo-elevation, palaeo-preipitation, dynamic topography data for the M1 and M3 model.

- 'inputs4': folder containg the netcdf and csv version of all inputs used for the AuM1, AuM2 and AuM3 models. This includes sea-level, erodbility structure, palaeo-elevation, palaeo-preipitation, dynamic topography data for the M1 and M3 model.

- 'AuM1outputs': outputs generated from Badlads for the AuM1 model. Including h5, xmf, xmdf and the input XML files.

- 'AuM2outputs': outputs generated from Badlads for the AuM2 model. Including h5, xmf, xmdf and the input XML files.

- 'AuM3outputs': outputs generated from Badlads for the AuM3 model. Including h5, xmf, xmdf and the input XML files.

- 'modelImages': the images from all the models generated from paraview. The images are for all time steps in elevation, cumulative erosion/depsotion, flow and basins.
